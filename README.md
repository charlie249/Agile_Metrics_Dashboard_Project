# Agile_Metrics_Dashboard_Project
This is where I will be completing my work based project for my university course. The project is hosted on a public GitHub repository, this repository is here: https://github.com/charlie249/Agile_Metrics_Dashboard_Project .

You run the project by opening up the index.html file which will show the outcome of the projects code.
