# Agile_Metrics_Dashboard_Project
This is where I will be completing my work based project for my university course. The project is hosted on a public GitHub repository, this repository is here: https://github.com/charlie249/Agile_Metrics_Dashboard_Project .

You run the project by opening up the index.html file which is inside the agile_metrics_dashboard_project folder and will show the outcome of the projects code. In order to make the project target a different issue all you have to do is change the issue number in the url of repo. To do this you open up the main.js file in a code editor of your choice (preferably VSCode) and where it says "const repo = await fetch('https://api.github.com/repos/serge-web/serge/issues/988');" you just change the issue number (988 in this case) to whatever issue number you are trying to find out information about.
